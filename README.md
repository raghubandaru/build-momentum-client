## Build Momentum

### Motivation

- How difficult is it to getting up and running with a goal?
- How many times people start learning new things or building new habits end abruptly?

I believe in accountability and consistency during the process, especially in the beginning. It is the sheer consistency over a period that builds momentum that accelerates the process of achieving goals.

I chose to develop a minimal web app that demonstrates technical skills and simulates the above process to fit my needs.
Each user can activate only one goal and work on it for a week. Add the tasks that direct you towards the goal and stay
accountable through the progress of the week. Rinse and Repeat!

### User Interface Technical Skills

- User Interface is developed using React.js.
- React Context API is used for global state management.
- Supports lazy loading and prefetching the components, thus only loading the necessary chunks.
- Styled-components (CSS-in-JS library) is used for styling.
